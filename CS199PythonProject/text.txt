@NickFondacaro @NBCNews @chucktodd So they‚Äôre already questioning the validity of #2020Election; so does that include if a Democrat wins or just if a Republican wins?                 i.e. @realDonaldTrump                      I.e. #VoterFraud                                 i.e. #DemocratsAreCorrupt

@MamaD15718191 @charliekirk11 Yikes. Biden doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing yet the media still trusts him. He needs to leave the race now and give #Yang2020 a chance. #YangMediaBlackout

@CNNBusiness @AndrewYang Disruptions are inevitable &amp; happening at an even faster pace than b4. And our govt &amp; public institutions are completely oblivious abt this issue. Now you know why trust in our govt is almost nil.  #YangGang #Yang2020
@schradenfreude @mehdirhasan @BernieSanders I totally agree. I supported @BernieSanders in the primary 2016, but the way he behaved and allowed his supporters to behave may have cost us the election. I don‚Äôt want anything to do w/him now. I sent the same caution to @AndrewYang and his #YangGang #Bernie2020 #Yang2020

Just completed a @YouGov poll by @CBS. The poll focused on the @DNC primary election. The majority of the questions focused on these five candidates...where the hell is @AndrewYang?

Just to clarify, this means Elizabeth Warren only made $2 million TOTAL in 30 yrs time - meaning she only made an average of $66,666 per yr!  She did NOT make $2 million per yr!  Considering her education, qualifications, &amp; experience, she was DRAMATICALLY UNDERPAID!  #Warren2020 https://t.co/bQO6rI2DWO

@ewarren didn't TAKE $2M, she EARNED it (1.9, actually)  She's not weak for rethinking her #M4A approach, she's strong  Weak leaders have a habit of crashing headlong into the rocks despite new data; strong leaders  correct their course and reach their objectives  #Warren2020

History shows candidates who lose the previous primary like Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, John Kerry, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders etc End up losing the next presidential race! What we need in 2020 is a new face! Someone who hasn't ran in the past! #Warren2020

@JonSWebster @manwell720 @PrettyGoodPhil @PeteButtigieg Actually, no, she doesn‚Äôt. Not even when 99% of people would. Her intelligence, accomplishments, steadiness and integrity make her the best choice for president in 2020. #Warren2020

@JohnMTalmadgeMD #Warren2020 seems sharp as a tack. It pains me to say it, because I wanted our first #GenX POTUS, but I think Warren is the way to go. If #KamalaHarris is VP, she may still be the first GenX POTUS. We deserve at least one, before the country starts electing only Millennials.

@YangVets Did someone seriously just asked Pete the question ‚ÄúWhat are the three most important things of being a president?‚Äù   Why don‚Äôt people ask how does he plan to beat Trump or how will Bloomberg‚Äôs ad buys affect the campaign?  #PeteButtigieg #PeteForPresident #Pete2020

.@PeteButtigieg even as one of your biggest supporters, I find this disturbing. This is unbecoming. And shady. And smug.  Whether you let press in or not is your choice, but you best find a better way to handle the press when asked legit questions. #pete2020 #petebuttigieg https://t.co/abiEzPFirN

@JordanUhl The issue I have with answering questions directly, is that you then set a precedent to be held accountable for what you say. #Pete2020

There‚Äôs some serious shade being flung at @PeteButtigieg right now &amp; it‚Äôs offensive, dishonest &amp; bot driven.

The "I'm under audit" of the democratic primary. @PeteButtigieg knows full well that McKinsey won't release this list.

I worked at McKinsey straight out of college in 1989 doing grocery pricing as well (ice cream &amp; frozen food to be exact).The goal was to determine a value proposition to the end-consumer. Nothing earth-shattering. But excellent training for analyzing all types of data. #Pete2020

@easychinedu I don't think it is all Dems. A small section of the twitterati who believes in impractical purity tests is afraid of the emergence of @PeteButtigieg, a candidate who can actually implement progressive policies, not just talk about them. #TeamPete #PeteForPresident #Pete2020

@RNCResearch #Klobuchar2020 your response is a joke. My take on this is that the country is divided because of what the DEMS have been doing for the last 3 years.

@DrGJackBrown #Bloomberg2020 &amp; #Steyer2020 if you really want to help liberal causes spend your millions funding liberal candidates. America doesn't want a choice between one billionaire or the other, we don't want an oligarchy, you'll have to be satisfied with your money, it disqualifies you.
Also #steyer2020 is setting his money on fire, but not at the same burn rate.
Tom Steyer is so behind the times. If he had https://t.co/Riwsoe4suL in 2016 that would have made sense.  Now in 2019, America is NOT GREAT. In fact it‚Äôs actually bloody awful for most Americans.  #Steyer2020 #TryAgainTom

Elizabeth Warren / Julian Castro= The winning ticket!! The press needs to pay more attention to Julian's policy proposals and stop skewing public opinion to certain white male (buttigieg/Biden) candidates.  It's not your choice!!! #Warren2020 #Castro2020

Kamala suspending her campaign shocked me.

I joined a #Castro2020 group on facebook because I want to know more about him. I actually like him for the most part, but my knowledge on his history &amp; record is limited.  I think Castro can be pushed further to the left and be a progressive ally.
The only male candidate I still support, who I think really gets it, is @JulianCastro. But if the mainstream Dems settle on Crazy Uncle Joe, &amp; @KamalaHarris as his VP, I will support, &amp; trust she will get him a worthy position in the administration. #KHive #Kamala2020 #Castro2020 https://t.co/t7UBVhCTPG

Although im #Warren2020, yesterday I donated to @JulianCastro campaign. I like him. His record is consistent &amp; hes good on policy. I want to hear more.  That and the fact that this field has been wayyyyyyyyy too diverse for another old, white, man become president. #Castro2020

Bloomberg is a bona fide racist.  "Appearing before nearly 400 people in Aspen on Feb. 5, the billionaire founder of Bloomberg L.P. argued that in order to save lives, police should seize guns from male minorities between ages 15 and 25." https://t.co/9nngn35jBZ #Bloomberg2020

I am starting to dislike @MikeBloomberg because the #Bloomberg2020 campaign ads are over played.
You know, if Michael Bloomberg really spent 37 billion on ads in the last 2 weeks...ugh. Think of what good he could‚Äôve done with that money. Think of how he could‚Äôve poured that money and energy into viable candidates. Or vets. Or the crisis at the border. #Bloomberg2020
I have yet to see or hear a single #mikebloomberg2020  #Bloomberg2020 ad, but the free media coverage of Bloomberg‚Äôs ad spend is seemingly unending. Reminds me of a previous presidential campaign, so how did that work out for everyone?

I think Bloopberg's campaign slogan, "Tax the Poor!" is going to be extremely effective &amp; propel him straight into the WH.  J/K  #Bloomberg2020
#Bloomberg2020 I'm in.  I listened to the interview on @CBSThisMorning

Haven‚Äôt felt like #Bloomberg2020 is adding anything to the conversation. In fact, I‚Äôve felt like his run is purely ego-driven and fracturing. But I gotta admit I‚Äôm less negative after seeing his @CBSThisMorning interview. #anyfunctioningadult2020

@CBSThisMorning @GayleKing @MikeBloomberg It is unfair for people to assume that because he is Rich, he is not for the people. He was elected 3 times to be Mayor in our city right after 911, the greatest crisis we ever had. We recovered and progresed during his ternure. #bloomberg2020
https://t.co/cxj3lk8hQs via @nypost glad to read about @MikeBloomberg plan for stronger gun control measures. However, mental illness is also a part of why these shootings seem to occur.  Hopefully Bloomberg will have a plan to battle that crises as well. #Bloomberg2020
@NRA #Bloomberg2020 do us all a big favor a drop out.  You have zero chances to win the presidency of the US.
@Bakari_Sellers Bloomberg's plan is very simple.  become president using your own money and profit off corruption.  #Bloomberg2020
#Bloomberg2020 It‚Äôs ashamed he doesn‚Äôt deal with mental health when he talks about gun control! Nor does he  deal with criminals and how do we address their use of guns!

Bloomberg is right now (3:34 pm/e) addressing an anti-gun group for the purpose of proposing his plan to ‚Äúend gun violence‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt seen him speak in probably 10 years, and I am interested to see if he has improved as a speaker. He has not. #Bloomberg2020

Has @MikeBloomberg bought his way into the next #DemocraticDebate yet?  Because, I'm getting sick of seeing his ads all over the place.  #Bloomberg2020
It's pretty disturbing how easily a rich asshole with no real team or ground game can jump to 5th in a few days after entering the race late, all because he has the money to drown out the competition. If the Dems pick him then we are truly lost #Bloomberg2020

I‚Äôm tired of thenbombardment of commercials by the #Bloomberg2020 campaign. If he wanted to run, he should‚Äôve decided much sooner.  It must be nice to opt of the debate process and just try to usurp the nomination with advertising #goaway @MikeBloomberg

I think we all need to face reality that Bloomberg is going to lead this Democratic ticket and we need to figure out how we're going to position his running mate. Is It going to be Booker, is it going to be Kamala or is it going to be Buttigieg? #Bloomberg2020

Kamala Harris yields to the rich white guy network of #Bloomberg2020 ,#Steyer, and Crazy Joe "bite me #Biden2020. Just imagine if one of these guys gets elected and has his fortune taxed away from him.
Hey, #Bloomberg2020 , guess who I'm not voting for!  I'll give you a hint, it rhymes with doomberg.
@laurenduca Yeah, that's the USA for ya ü§£üòÇ Have you looked at Congress lately? #Ayeayeaye @KamalaHarris never had a chance &amp; neither does @TomSteyer or #Bloomberg2020 or any other lying, hypocrite, anti-American #Demoncrat

@seanhannity Joe Biden will drop out soon. Do #Dems really want #Bloomberg2020? Clinton will go in full force and push bloomberg out.
Just a reminder. As mayor of New York City, Mike Bloomberg‚Äôs  education policy:   -deepened segregation -hurt the most needy students in the city -created a separate and unequal system of education that benefited more privileged students  #MikeBloomberg2020  #Bloomberg2020
Comparison b/w #Bloomberg2020 &amp; #KamalaHarris2020:  Whether you like or dislike #Bloomberg &amp; #KamalaHarris, THIS is the reason why BUYING elections has to go away.  No matter the party, when the #NYT piece came out about the Harris campaign - we knew she was done.
@kabuli07 @SophiaAssani We‚Äôre now only left with one strong candidate. #Bloomberg2020 The man capable enough to run and lose to trump.
@Mike2020 I own the @SouthBoxGym gym located in the South Bronx, we do lots for the youth and community. I would love to help your campaign #Bloomberg2020

@brithume How #Bloomberg2020 dictate what people can do with their lives! Poor people are full of despair.. Let them live! Instead of taxing them, how about raising the minimum wage, so they can climb out of the abyss &amp; start to achieve!
I wish you would use your well earned funds to "mop the floor" with Trump's face. He deserves lots of bad press. Let him pay the price for using his Presidential megaphone for evil instead of good. #Bloomberg2020
#SIASD Even  @realDonaldTrump must know that @business #MikeBloomberg can just read the @WhiteHouse #Twitter rants &amp; that‚Äôs all the access anyone wants or needs. Why bother covering #LiesLiesLies ???   #Bloomberg2020
@BernieSanders @MikeBloomberg is very intelligent. This hyper focused shade you are serving is worrisome. Why are you so concerned about him? #Bloomberg2020
AAaaaaaand Away with Vote Blue no matter who. I will NOT vote for this asshat - ever! He's a bald trump! #Bloomberg2020 No Damn Way!! @bpolitics https://t.co/8oYw65WkKq

@thehill The fact that #Bloomberg2020 is an opposition candidate for president should be reason enough. Any reports from #Bloombergnews are sure to be one sided. Where is the uproar for Bloomberg to step down from his business?
You know who gets under trumps skin?  #Bloomberg !  We need to look at Bloomberg seriously!!!  He's a self made millionaire actually billionaire!!!  Unlike #tRump who is a liar and in debt and NOT a Billionaire  #Bloomberg2020   watch some of his YouTube interviews  #Impressive
Totally agree with the stance of the campaign and #GOP.  To say they are only going to investigate #Trump and no one else, including their boss, is unethical and possibly illegal (it may be a campaign contribution).   #Bloomberg2020 #FakeNewsMedia #KAG2020 https://t.co/LoB1NXpuMN
@ABCPolitics tRump‚Äôs ears aren‚Äôt burning since he doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúcouple of billion dollars‚Äù, unless you count the debt. As far as #Bloomberg2020 goes, I‚Äôm afraid #BernieBaby has a contender who has actually run a government and gotten things accomplished. But both are well past their prime.
BREAK..Donald Trump's campaign BANS Bloomberg News reporters from covering events.. @CNN @NBCNews @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC @business @latimes @MSNBC @BBCBreaking @FT #Bloomberg2020 @washingtonpost
Nor should they since @bpolitics abdicated the journalist role when they decided not to report on either #Bloomberg2020 or #Democrats running for president. https://t.co/iwT1UATsHz
