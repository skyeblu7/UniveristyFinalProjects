## Project Summary

Many websites provide details and information on various credit cards. Although all of these cards have standardized information, users often must toggle through many pages and websites to see all of the relevant details for the hundreds of available credit cards. While some websites such as [NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/) and [CreditKarma](https://www.creditkarma.com/), compile subsets of credit cards and provide some manually curated comparisons, this information is limited to a small subset of credit cards and is often text based making it more difficult for users to provide broader comparisons. In addition, to get more minor details, users must toggle to the actual card’s website to view details related to preferred vendors, point redemption, and APR. 

Illini CC’d will be a website which contains a compiled and standardized dataset of hundreds of different credit cards. By having a single standardized source of information for all things credit card, users of Illini CC’d will be able to quickly evaluate credit cards, perform comparisons, and select the credit card which best suits their needs. In addition, this solution will stand out by providing users a single UI for all credit cards versus having to toggle through many different pages. The website will include a summary table which shares with users standardized details of the many credit cards available on the market. Users will also be able to execute customized searches and filters on this table to help identify subsets of cards which meet their needs. In addition, by answering several questions, users will be able to receive personalized credit card recommendations. Finally, users will be able to see what credit cards other users of the site are looking at to gain a better understanding of what cards are currently popular.
